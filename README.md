# Everything Cards
---- gamify learning, skill tree with t he topics that you must maintain
  - python, numphy and in general programming language concepts, functions, advanced syntax etc
  - algs, like KMP, Kruskal, Dijkstra, SLiding window algs (scrii codul, dupa sunt intrebari care te intreaba ce face linia asta, ce face linia aia, etc.... tu trb sa scrii in comentarii)
  - theory about ML (backprop, stochastic gradient descent), with follow-up questions  - theory about Deep Learning 
  - data engineering tasks (processing some things, also theory parts)
  - depp learning theory (wwhat is the pooling layer, etc....)
  - image processsing tasks
  - explain formulas from ML models
  - questions like what is the difference between YOLO and CNN (for computer vision)?
  - learn a topic, then be given short questions about it
  - explain soemthing to someone, have gemini API say if it is correct or not 

- code comentarry questions, multiple choice, code editor questions
- make a code editor, users can write code
  - syntax highlighting
  - run the code against some tests, to verify the output
  - put restriction on lines of code in the editor, restrictions on line length, restrict some keywords
